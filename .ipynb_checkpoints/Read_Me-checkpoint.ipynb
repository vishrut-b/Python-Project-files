    "3. Then I create a module called \"mod.py\", where I have defined several functions depending upon their intended purpose. 'details' is a simple function which basically returns the value of the order we choose and the ideal number of HEALPIX cells it should contain. 'current_order' also returns the value of the order we choose, along with the corresponding HEALPix cells extract from the HEALPix column of that order. The final result of this function is a list of sorted and unique HEALPix cells. The next function I define is called \"increase_order\", and it gives us the HEALPix cells of the order one step above the one we choose for the function. This function is not used in the final and the most import function \"My_MOC\", which builds the MOC tree, but I have kept it just for conceptual clarity about how the MOC actually works. Function \"My_MOC\" builds the MOC tree. "
